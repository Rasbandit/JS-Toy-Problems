    // Teacher notes
    // This one requires a good amount of knowledge of 'this' and how it works when we move
    // the fn of the object.
    // 'this' will always be the object to the immediate left of the function being invoked. That
    // is always the case, not just when we have a method on an object. Technically when you
    // just have a function on the global scope 'this' is the window/global object.
    // Below on step 2 when we save the method to the fn we can also invoke it using `window.fn()`.
    // This means if we have an object called state on the global scope the function will use that one,
    // but only if you use var, not let or const.
    // You may also be tempted to use an arrow function for the method, 'this' will always be the window
    // and can not be rebound.
    // On step 4 when we set it as a property of the props object 'this' becomes the prop object, not
    // personTwo

    var person = {
      state: {
        name: 'Bob Ross',
        favoriteThings: ['Happy little Trees', 'Happy Accidents', 'Groves', 'Mountains'],
        age: '54',
      },
      greet: function (greeter) {
        //Notice we will be checking what 'this' is every time we run the function
        console.log(this)
        return `Hello ${greeter}, My name is ${this.state.name}. do you like ${this.state.favoriteThings[0]}?`
      }
    }

    // Step 1
    // Run the greet method on the person object.
    // Pay close attention to what the console log of 'this' prints.


    // Step 2
    // Now create a variable called fn and save person.greet to it.
    // Run the fn function and notice what 'this' is in the console.


    // Step 3
    // If we pass person.greet as a parameter to a function and run
    // it we will see the same issue.

    function callerBack(greet, name) {
      greet(name)
    }
    // Invoke callerBack and pass in person.greet and a name
    // You should see that it breaks all because of 'this'
    // 'this' is the window object and it does not have the state property.
    // How can we ensure that function uses the correct 'this' and let us
    // access persons state property?


    // Step 4
    // Now for this step create a new property on personTwo.props called greet
    // and give it the value of person.greet.
    const personTwo = {
      state: {
        name: 'Tim Allen',
        favoriteThings: ['Home Improvement'],
        age: '65',
      },
      props: {
        job: 'fixer',
        friends: ['Al Borland', 'Wilson Wilson Jr.']
      },
    }

    // Run personTwo.props.greet and notice what 'this' is.
    // Notice 'this' still does not see state! But it does see the job and
    // friend properties. Interesting.


    // Step 5
    // There is a fix to ensure you function remembers what 'this' should be.
    // look up '.bind' and try and redo steps 2, 3 and 4 but use your new found
    // knowledge about '.bind' to make sure it remembers what 'this' is.
