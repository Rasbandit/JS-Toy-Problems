// To the Moon

// If you folded a piece of paper in half enough you could theoretically reach any height, but how many times would you have to fold to reach a desired height?

// Write a function that takes in a single number as a parameter.
// Return how many times would you need to fold a piece of paper to reach the input distance.
// Assume all distances are done in meters, no conversions needed.

// A piece of paper has a thickness of 0.0001.
// The distance to the moon is 384400000

// Bonus Challenge
// Use a while loop
