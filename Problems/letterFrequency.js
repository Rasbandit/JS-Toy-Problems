// Letter Frequency

// Write a function that will take in a single string.
// The function will tally how many times each letter appears in the string.
// The tally will be kept in an object with the property being the letter and the value being how many were found.
// Return the object with how the count of each letter found.
// Ignore Spaces

// Bob Ross -> {b: 2, o: 2, r: 1, s: 2}
// taco cat -> {t: 2, a: 2, c: 2, o: 1}



// Bonus Challenge
// Alter the function so it instead takes in two strings.
// We want to see if we rearrange the letters of the first string can we enough letters to make the second string.
// If that is possible return true, if it is not return false.

//('Bob Ross', 'bos ros') -> true
//('Bob Ross', 'boss ross') -> false
//('Bob Ross', 'tim allen') -> false
