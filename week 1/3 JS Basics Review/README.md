# Week 1 Day 3 - JS Basics Review

## Main Topics

- data types 
- truthy/falsy
- scope
- arguments vs parameters

## Lecture notes

It is very important to start drilling into the students as early as possible the important of data types. Not having the data types memorized would be like trying to learn english without memorizing the alphabet. It can be done but makes it very difficult. (I consider arrays to be a datatype separate from objects, which is not strictly true but for the sake of new students it should be. Also many other programing langues have arrays as a different type so its not the worst idea.)

It is also a good time to start making a distinction between data types and patterns. For instance a callback is a pattern that involves functions, there is no such thing as a callback. Bring this up with truthy/falsy, those are more of a concept/pattern that is unique to JS.
