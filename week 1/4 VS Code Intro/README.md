## Synopsis

As the teacher of this lecture it could be a good idea to watch all the videos under the overview section in the repo called `vs-code-intro`, as that is all the content that you should cover in the exercise. Also, slacking out the repo vs-code-intro so they can use it for reference later..

Often the most "Basic" and "Simple" things are over looked and not ever explained to the students. In the past we never took any time to explain the features of VSCode and all the cool things that come with it. We either don't take the time ourselves to learn what it offers, or we just expect students to take the time to learn all the features, and this is rarely ever true. I have found the average person never opens the settings menu and thus never knows what the software is capable of.

In this exercise it will be a mentor going over as many tools and features in VSCode as possible. Focus primarily on the interface and all the buttons, not so much on the features of text manipulation. Do not gloss over anything if you can help it. It is better to assume they know literally nothing rather than gloss over things you assume people know, (like ctrl-c for copy). It's always surprising to me what students don't know. For instance, don't be afraid to explain what a folder is and how we can see its contents.

We don't make time to go over keyboard shortcuts but that is included in the vs-code-intro repo so students can learn those on their own time.
