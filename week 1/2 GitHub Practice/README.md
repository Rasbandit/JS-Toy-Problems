# Week 1 Day 2 - Command Line and Git

## Goal

The purpose of this exercise is to help get more practice using the command prompt and git.

## Notes

Most students are very intimated by the command line so taking the time to have them practice it all again is very worth the time. I recommend giving them 20-30 minutes to work on their own before the exercise leader walks them through it.
