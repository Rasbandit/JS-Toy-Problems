// Over a few toy problems we will be building out a class that keeps track of a
// shopping cart object that also includes a few methods to manipulate the data.

// To start you will want to make a class called Cart that includes a constructor
// function. Have the constructor function take in a single parameter that will
// be the items in the cart. Set that value equal to a value called this.cart

// Second we will want to create a method that will take in an id and then remove
// the item from the cart with the matching id, also make sure to account for if
// the id that is passed in that is not found.
