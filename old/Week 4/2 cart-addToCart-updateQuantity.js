// We will be building onto the same Cart class from earlier.
// We will be adding on the addToCart and updateQuantity methods.
// First we will be building out the functionality to add items to a cart.
// This method will take in an object that will be the item to add to the cart.
// Before we can just add the item to the cart we need to check if that item already exists.
// If it does exist just increase the quantity by one, if it does not add it into the cart array.
// Recalculate the total.

// Second we are adding in the ability to update the quantity of a specific item in
// the cart. This method will take in two parameters, first being the id of the
// item to update, and second the quantity to set it to.

// don't forget to calculate at the end of these methods.

// Bonus
// Use the findIndex Method
