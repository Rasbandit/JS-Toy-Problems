# Cart

We will be using a class to build out a cart object with methods that will modify the cart object. This should take them a few days to get through maybe 2 or 3 but at the end it should be one class with multiple methods that manipulate the cart data.

On the first day have them set up the class and using the constructor to have a place to put the cart array. We will be revisiting the constructor in later steps.
