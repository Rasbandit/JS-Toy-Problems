// We will be building onto the same Cart class from earlier.
// The final step will be building out the functionality to add items to a cart.
// This method will take in an object that will be the item to add to the cart.
// Before we can just add the item to the cart we need to check if that item already exists.
// If it does exist just increase the quantity by one, if it does not push it into the cart.
// Recalculate the total.
