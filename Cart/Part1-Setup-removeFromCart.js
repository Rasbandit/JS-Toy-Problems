// Over a few toy problems we will be building out a class that constructs a cart object and also includes a few methods to manipulate the data, things like adding to the cart and calculating the total.
// To start you will want to make a class called Cart that includes a constructor function. Have the constructor function take in a single parameter that will be the items in the cart. Set that value equal to a value called this.cart
// Second we will want to create a method that will take in an id and then remove the item from the cart with the matching id
// You will want to save this because we will be adding to it in the future.
