# Week 2 Day 3 - HTML Layout

The purpose of this toy problem is to help students apply their recently learned flexbox skills in css/html.


For this toy problem have the students attempt to recreate the image below in an html/css file on their own. Give the students some time to attempt it on their own and then either show your solution and discuss or attempt to replicate it with student input.
