# Week 2 Day 1 - Debugging Methodology

## Goal

The purpose of this guide is to help students understand the debugging process. We will set expectations and thought processes to help them learn how to do this on their own.

## Lesson

This lecture should be lead the whole time by the instructor. The goal is not to debugg the code, but to show how we can come to conclusions.

First important topic to go over is what programming is based off of. I bring up the idea that everyone has heard stating `programming is the language of logic`. A statement that everyone claims to understand, until they are asked to define the word `logic`. Ask the students to define it, then go to google and define logic. Its still not the most helpful way of understanding what logic means but there is a synonymy that helps a lot, `argumentation`. When you look that up and you realize that `arguing` and `logic` are the same thing. But we need to specify further that when we say `arguing` we don't mean a heated debate, we man two parties discussing a topic with the intent to come to the truth of the matter. When it is between two people its about a 33-33 chance who is correct, with another 33% chance neither are correct. To be a good arguer is not someone who wins arguments, but someone that is committed to coming to truth, and being ok with examining their own beliefs and realizing they could be wrong.

So if you are going to be a good programmer you need to learn how to argue, from a logical standpoint. But a key difference here is that the computer is always right, and you are always wrong. And boy can that be frustrating. If you have not already there will come a time in your programing career where you will start arguing with your computer emotionally. You start telling the computer "NO! im right, that is how this works" and the computer just gives the same error and refuses to work. 

This is the processing of debugging. The debugger is only a tool that helps if you first understand this process. So today during the lecture we are going to spend time console.log ing and figruing out how to figure things out, or to call it by its correct term, how to `reason`
